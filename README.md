# 🚀 Project Name

_Baby activity tracker — Log and view your baby nap, food and potty activity and find the patterns?_

---

## 📖 Overview

BabyTrack is a full-stack Flask application designed to log, store, and visualize baby activity data such as feeding, sleeping, diaper changes. The app supports both manual input from caregivers and automated data collection (e.g., via sensors or scheduled inputs).

Collected data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and exposed through a separate view for visualization, review, or export, making it easy to track patterns over time and support better care decisions.

This project showcases end-to-end backend and data engineering skills, including API development, relational data modeling, user input validation, and basic data analytics.
